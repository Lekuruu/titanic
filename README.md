# Titanic

Titanic is a private server made to be compatible with all osu! stable clients (2008-2024).
The goal of this project was to gain deeper insights into the inner workings of Bancho and how it changed over the years.

You can play on it, by [registering on our website](https://osu.titanic.sh/account/register), and [downloading](https://osu.titanic.sh/download) a client.
For more questions, feel free to join our Discord server: https://discord.gg/qupv72e7YH

The main goal of this project was achieved. However, there are still a good amount of features that we want to add, which you can view [here](https://github.com/users/osuTitanic/projects/2).
